Jail, jail, jail
My dad is in a jail
Hey baby wake up from your asleep
This campus is a gigantic joke
I love my dad
I hate my dad
New Media is nothing but a joke
I sure love being in a jail
jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail 
I hate my dad and fill the void with bi on ickles
Herd u ben gabbin off about me nan
A party funeral on the river sticks and you know its for my dad
